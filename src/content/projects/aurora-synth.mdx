## Overview

Aurora Synth ingests design tokens and renders a generative gradient system that reacts to audio input and product data streams. It serves as a live canvas during stakeholder reviews.

## Stack

- Custom Web Audio pipeline for smoothing frequency data
- Layered shader materials with fallbacks for low-power devices
- Reusable token inspector built with MDX components

## Impact

The visualization became a central touchpoint for communicating brand direction, helping cross-disciplinary teams reach alignment 30% faster during quarterly reviews.
