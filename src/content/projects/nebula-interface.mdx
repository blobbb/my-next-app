## Concept

A guided product tour that blends cinematic lighting with dynamic data overlays. Users explore a configurable space while a narrative timeline syncs with interactions.

## Highlights

- Integrated **React Three Fiber** scenes with Framer Motion choreographies.
- MDX-driven story blocks empower content teams to iterate quickly without touching code.
- Adaptive performance budgets ensure buttery-smooth motion down to mid-tier mobile GPUs.

## Implementation Details

```tsx
const lightingRig = useMemo(() => createLightingRig(), []);
return <Scene lighting={lightingRig} overlays={overlays} />;
```

## Results

- +42% dwell time on hero product page
- 18% growth in qualified demo requests within the first quarter
- Modular storytelling system reused across 3 additional campaigns
