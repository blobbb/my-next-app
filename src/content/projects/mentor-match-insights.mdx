## Overview

Partnered with Minnesota Big Brothers Big Sisters through the MinneMUDAC competition to understand which mentor and youth attributes drive successful long-term matches. The work combined exploratory data analysis, clustering, and supervised learning to recommend mentor-mentee pairings.

## Approach

- Cleaned and imputed missing survey responses and tenure data to create consistent training features.
- Built gradient boosted decision trees and logistic regression baselines to predict match length, using SHAP values to surface transparent drivers.
- Delivered dashboards that allow coordinators to filter by geography, interests, and experience to identify mentors with the strongest predicted retention.

## Results

- Highlighted three actionable predictors (weekly availability, professional background, and mentee activity interests) linked to >15% longer average match duration.
- Provided pairing recommendations that program staff can incorporate into their intake workflow, along with explainable model outputs for confident decision making.
- Presented findings in a judging session, demonstrating how machine learning can directly support community mentorship outcomes.
